							<p>I fought and I failed. <br />
Against society, the dictating rules of culture which binds us all together. <br />
Let me go back a few days and explain what happened.<br /><br />
I had been employed by the sewing factory, Birling and Co, for two years. And within that timeframe, almost nothing changed.<br /><br />
This may seem a benefit: we all have a place to work, a luxury to the many homeless I would see when walking to the factory. Looking back, I would ignore and disregard them just as society implies. However, now they almost show me my own future, as I will describe later in this post.<br /><br />
When nothing changes, and the rest of culture progresses, then I find the quality of life suffers. Just like what happened at the factory, prices rise, accommodation inflated, but our wages did neither. We were still on the same twenty-two and six shilling which we had been given for the two years and we were all suffering. <br /><br />
Food started to become scarce and hunger soon loomed over all of us, especially those who had families to take care of and individuals who were in troubled relationships.<br /><br />

My actions next were inevitable. Our own desperation desired a higher wage for our safety and after hearing about the 25-shilling wage at Crofts Limited, I decided to question Mr. Birling, the crumb in charge of the work.<br /><br />

He did not seem to express any concern for us. He turned to anger to express himself and even tried to persuade me to stay for a promotion to a leading operator. I refused. It may turn out to be a mistake, but my desire for equality outweighs my hunger for power.<br /><br />

'A good worker' is what I was named. Just another good worker to him until he promotes someone else and the cycle is repaired. However, the truth is that if I was man I would have been respected and cared for. The working system only benefits one kind of person. And now, I am on the complete opposite side of this reality.<br /><br />

I dream of a world where women are not treated as lower class, where we are respected for what we do and not taunted by what we cannot. I want to live in a world where equality is just as important as national defence and opportunities arise to those who work for them and those who are born to them.<br /><br />

For now, I have been left to defend myself alone. A reality with no money, no power and no respect. However, the true reality is that I am not alone and just another domino to fall. My only belonging are the same people who I once ignored.<br /><br />

Please, if there is anyone out there, I need help. If anyone is reading this, it does not matter what occupation you have or what status you obtain, I need someone. <br /><br />

Mummy would have known what to do. <br />
But for now, the future looks bleak.

								<h2>Update: January 1911</h2>
							</header>

							<p>
                                Alone. Once again. <br /><br />

Let me start a few months back. At least it seems like a few months to me: time moves in strange patterns when by yourself.<br /><br />

After months of desperate search, living alone, squiffy, on the streets after being mistreated by Birling and Co. Something wonderful happened.<br />
An influenza epidemic.<br /><br />
This may seem like its pure moonshine, but then people needed labour more than ever and after an interview with Mr. Renton at Milwards I was employed.<br /><br />
I was so excited, something new to work on, a new goal in my life. And this time was different. Milwards was a retail clothes shop, where they cared about their employees and gave me a 25-shilling wage, as it should be.<br /><br />
I found a hidden love with the vibrancy of the clothes. There were not just reds and greens and blues but whole different shades in between bursting through and burning at many different extremes. Colours which I never knew existed, in what appears to be such a dull life, were arranged in complex patterns that gleamed and shined in such beautiful ways. It was such a peculiar experience. <br /><br />                          
But, it made me happy, it taught me to smile even if the day was over or the bitter cold took its toll on my sleep. Once I could feel the silk, that I spent a previous lifetime perfecting, through my bear and neglected figures, once I could hear the colours shouting out to me, inviting me, I knew I could make it through the next night. <br /><br />

However, this was a downfall, it seems.<br /><br />

Each day came and went with bliss, and with each day confidence grew. However, for one day, all this never even started and its taking an eternity to end. I was serving customers as usual, when one young women came up to me and asked for advice. She was not working class; you could tell from the crystals on her wrist to the smooth, almost, artificial gleam on her hair. I did my best to cater for her. I even recommended for her to try on the clothes. She listened to me, which seemed strange that I suddenly had such power over this wealthier female. So, she tried it on and I smiled at her; a friendly smile, one which has seemed to be routine every day. However, immediately the atmosphere changed, and the women started to shout at me, she called Mr Renton where he just sacked me right there. Told me to not come back tomorrow. No warning, no sorrow, no care. I was left defenceless, as if I was an infant again where other people dictated my actions.  <br /><br />
So back to where I always go: worthlessness. When you are at this stage, not even those who you thought were friends ever care to stop. They know I am there, but now I am just a lost soul in their peripheral vision. Regret may be advertised across their face, and I see it sometimes, but the conforming rules of society always succeed. Just ignore. Just walk on.<br /><br />

Mummy used to say change was good. Maybe she's right, even if it does not seem that way currently. But, if there is one advantage, at least change distracts me from the pain. The pain of isolation.<br /><br />

For I will continue, but Eva Smith will be no more.<br /><br />
